        "The planning team devised two Key Ecological Attributes (KEAs) and associated indicators to assess the current connectivity status of the watershed â€“ Accessible Habitat and Accessible Overwintering Habitat (@tbl-connectivity). KEAs are the key aspects of anadromous salmon ecology that are being targeted by this WCRP. The connectivity status of Anadromous Salmon was used to establish goals to improve habitat connectivity in the watershed and will be the baseline against which progress is tracked over time. \n",
        "\n",
        "The current connectivity status assessment relies on GIS analyses to map known and modelled barriers to fish passage, identify stream reaches that have potential spawning and rearing habitat, estimate the proportion of habitat that is currently accessible to target species, and prioritize barriers for field assessment that would provide the greatest gains in connectivity. To support a flexible prioritization framework to identify priority barriers in the watershed, two assumptions are made: 1,any modelled (i.e., passability status is unknown) or partial barriers are treated as complete barriers to passage and 2, the habitat modelling is binary, it does not assign any habitat quality values. As such, the current connectivity status will be refined over time as more data on habitat and barriers are collected. For more detail on how the connectivity status assessments were conducted, see Appendix B. \n"
