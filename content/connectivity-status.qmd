# Connectivity Status Assessment and Goals {-}

## Connectivity Status Assessment {-}

The planning team devised two Key Ecological Attributes (KEAs) and associated indicators to assess the current connectivity status of the watershed â€“ Accessible Habitat and Accessible Overwintering Habitat (@tbl-connectivity). KEAs are the key aspects of anadromous salmon ecology that are being targeted by this WCRP. The connectivity status of Anadromous Salmon was used to establish goals to improve habitat connectivity in the watershed and will be the baseline against which progress is tracked over time. 

The current connectivity status assessment relies on GIS analyses to map known and modelled barriers to fish passage, identify stream reaches that have potential spawning and rearing habitat, estimate the proportion of habitat that is currently accessible to target species, and prioritize barriers for field assessment that would provide the greatest gains in connectivity. To support a flexible prioritization framework to identify priority barriers in the watershed, two assumptions are made: 1,any modelled (i.e., passability status is unknown) or partial barriers are treated as complete barriers to passage and 2, the habitat modelling is binary, it does not assign any habitat quality values. As such, the current connectivity status will be refined over time as more data on habitat and barriers are collected. For more detail on how the connectivity status assessments were conducted, see Appendix B. 



```{python echo=FALSE}
#| label: tbl-connectivity
#| tbl-cap: "Connectivity status assessment for (a) linear habitat (spawning and rearing) and (b) overwintering habitat in the Horsefly River watershed. The Available Habitat KEA is evaluated by dividing the length of linear habitat that is currently accessible to target species by the total length of all linear habitat in the watershed. The Available Overwintering Habitat KEA is evaluated as the sum of all areal overwintering habitat that is accessible to target species."

**Comments:** Indicator rating definitions are based on the consensus decisions of the planning team, including the decision not to define Fair. The current status is based on the CWF Barrier Prioritization Model output, which is current as of March 2022.

```

**Comments:** No baseline data exists on the extent of overwintering habitat in the watershed. A priority action is included in the Operational Plan (strategy 2.3) to develop a habitat layer, and this will be used to inform this connectivity status assessment in the future.
