To achieve this goal, the plan will guide which structures to assess in the field, and subsequently, which barriers to address (i.e., remove or replace the barrier, or temporarily add fish passage). To maximize conservation efforts/resources towards achieving this goal, it is imperative to identify a suite of barriers that, if addressed, will provide the largest, most important contribution towards restored connectivity of salmon and eel habitat. The following section outlines the ranking process to identify the list of barriers.",

    "text": "Field Assessment Ranking Process\nAfter all existing data and knowledge are collated for known and modelled crossings, an iterative ranking process was conducted. The ranking process is primarily used to guide field assessments and maximize efficiency in ground truthing data/knowledge inputs and model outputs, while providing a secondary purpose to evaluate the relative key habitat gains of confirmed barriers in the watershed. Field assessments can include an assessment of either the passability status of a structure (whether fish can pass upstream, and to what degree), whether the upstream habitat is suitable for the focal species, and whether there are other undocumented anthropogenic or natural barriers upstream or downstream. First, structures are grouped into ‘sets’. Sets are identified by maximizing the key habitat gain for barriers in the same tributary system. If adding a structure to a set reduces the gain-per-barrier (i.e., the total habitat gain of the set divided by the number of barriers in the set), then it is excluded and will be considered part of another set. This results in sets ranging from one to five structures (see Appendix A for more details on this process). Then, each set is ranked by its potential to contribute to restoring the overall habitat connectivity. The higher a set is ranked, the more potential contribution it makes to restoring the overall habitat connectivity, therefore making the set a higher priority for field assessment. By assessing the passability status and upstream habitat of the top-ranked sets, we close knowledge gaps with the greatest influence on the overall connectivity model results.\nSets are ranked by a combination of two factors:\n\nThe long-term potential impact that restoring connectivity at that structure could have on the overall connectivity status. This was measured by calculating and ranking sets by the amount of total upstream key habitat (i.e., ignoring any additional upstream sets). This ranking identifies sets that would have the greatest long-term potential gain in habitat connectivity once any subsequent upstream barriers are addressed.\nThe immediate potential impact that restoring connectivity at that structure could have on the overall connectivity status. This was measured by calculating the amount of functional upstream habitat (i.e., key habitat between that set and the next upstream set of structures). Sets were then ranked by functional upstream habitat amount in tiers, where sets with no downstream sets were ranked first, then sets with one downstream set, and so on. This ranking identifies sets that have the greatest immediate potential gain in habitat by prioritizing sets that do not rely on rehabilitation of downstream or upstream sets to realize these gains.\n\nAn overall ranking for each set was produced as a composite of the long-term and immediate potential gain ranks to prioritize sets that maximize long-term and immediate potential to improve key habitat connectivity in the watershed. All structures in the watershed (excluding those confirmed as passable) were ranked and a subset of those structures were selected by the planning team to assess in the 2023 field season.",

Depending on the barrier, owner, financial constraints, and quality of upstream habitat, the action may be to leave to end of life cycle before reviewing again, remove and decommission the road, replace with a new passable structure, or modify to temporarily restore connectivity (e.g., fish ladder or baffles installed (Table 1).\nAssessed structures that remain data deficient list – some form of field assessment has been completed on the structure, but further investigation is required to confirm either the passability status or upstream habitat.\nRehabilitated barriers list – priority barriers that have been addressed (either through removal, replacement, or temporary fish passage improvement projects (Table 2).\nNon-actionable barriers list – the structure is confirmed to be a barrier to fish passage and have some amount/quality of habitat upstream, but the planning team will not identify actions to address passability of the barrier because of logistic considerations (e.g., financial costs), short habitat gain, or the upstream habitat is of poor quality or unsuitable in its present condition to support key life stages of the focal species (Appendix B).\nExcluded structures list – the structure is excluded from further consideration in subsequent ranking and work planning because the structure is confirmed passable (e.g., bridge), not present, or there is no key habitat upstream (Appendix B).\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: The Maqmekwitk watershed priority barrier list, which includes barriers that have undergone field assessment, been reviewed by the planning team, and selected to be addressed (whether removed, replaced with a passable structure, or provided temporary fish passage).AS = Atlantic Salmon; AE = American Eel; CBS = closed bottom structure.\n\n\nBarrier IDWatercourse NameRoad NameStructure TypePassability Status (AS)Passability Status (AE)Number Barriers GroupTotal Habitat Gain in Set - AS (km)Total Habitat Gain in Set - AE (km)PriorityNext Steps7df79d64-77e8-42a6-af8c-f7ae4cbd5e9fSt. CroixEvangaline TrailDam003119.996.9HighBring barrier to regulator93c5a3a7-bb1c-462f-bf11-8b28f1083ea8St. CroixSalmon Hole Dam RdDam003119.996.9HighBring barrier to regulator4c4d6443-ba54-46dc-bf2c-51922ccb62ccSt. CroixSalmon Hole Dam RdDam003119.996.9HighBring barrier to regulatore4939efd-23a2-4fa7-9622-e5877d9b323cShaw BrookAvondale RoadAboiteaux0024.61.9LowEngage with partnersa90277b6-8708-43ef-a867-86827c4c698fBog BrookRail lineStream crossing - CBS0028.54.5HighEngage with barrier owner02667d40-b792-43e6-94c0-74427481e12aHerbert RiverTrail off Beaverbank RdStream crossing - CBS0012.71.8MediumIdentify barrier owner753ad5c4-da00-40d1-9cc9-fbc6cbdade4cNix BrookUnnamed logging roadStream crossing - CBS0014.32.2HighIdentify barrier ownerae23e5dd-8496-487a-9c95-eae4f63c3cfcBeaver BrookAshdale RoadStream crossing - CBS0012.11.9HighEngage with barrier owner77b3d637-21cb-4728-8548-11d5b02daf22St. CroixS Rawdon RdStream crossing - CBS6.93.8LowLeave until end of lifecycle\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Rehabilitated structures in the Maqmekwitk watershed.AS = Atlantic Salmon; AE = American Eel.\n\n\nBarrier IDWatercourse NameRoad NameAssessment Step CompleteTotal Habitat Gain in Set - AS (km)Total Habitat Gain in Set - AE (km)Next Steps5c859868-f6b5-4291-88ea-d2ed7f0ef41bBog BrookRail lineBarrier assessment0.970.72Post-rehabilitation monitoring",

Grouping structures into sets starts by taking the most downstream structure (e.g., structure A) in the stream and the next structure immediately upstream of it (e.g., structure B) and calculates the average gain per structure in that set (structure A+B/2). This process is repeated with sets increasing from two structures to five structures (e.g., structure A+B+C+D+E/5). The set with the highest average gain per structure is grouped together. Structures are left as individuals if adding a second structure reduces the average gain per structure (e.g., structure A &gt; structure A+B/2). After this set is grouped, the algorithm moves to the next structure upstream of the set and repeats the process iteratively until all structures in the stream are in a set and the entire process repeats for each stream in the network.",

    "text": "Project Scope\nConnectivity is a critical component of freshwater ecosystems that encompasses a variety of factors related to ecosystem structure and function, such as the ability of aquatic species to disperse and/or migrate, the transportation of energy and matter (e.g., nutrient cycling and sediment flows), and temperature regulation (Seliger and Zeiringer (2018)). Though each of these factors are important when considering the health of a watershed, for the purpose of this project the term “connectivity” is defined as the degree to which aquatic species can disperse and/or migrate freely through freshwater systems. Within this context, connectivity is primarily constrained by physical barriers, including human-made infrastructure such as dams and stream crossings, and natural features such as waterfalls. This plan will focus on the direct rehabilitation and prevention of localized, physical barriers instead of the broad, land-use patterns causing chronic connectivity issues in the watershed. The planning team decided that the primary focus of this watershed connectivity plan is addressing barriers to longitudinal connectivity (i.e., along the upstream-downstream plane) due to the importance of maintaining fish passage to spawning and rearing habitat in the watershed.",

    "text": "Focal species\nFocal species represent the ecologically and culturally important species for which habitat connectivity is being directly conserved and/or restored in the watershed. The planning team selected two target species: Plamu (Atlantic Salmon) and Kataq (American Eel). The selection of these key species was driven primarily by local conservation goals.\n\nAtlantic Salmon | Plamu | Salmo salar\nAtlantic Salmon are anadromous fishes, meaning mature adults spawn in freshwater and juveniles rear in freshwater before undergoing a process called smoltification where they migrate out to the ocean for 1-3+ years before returning to the freshwater to repeat this process. Due to this migratory process, salmon require unimpeded access between the ocean and freshwater habitats to complete their life cycle.\nAtlantic Salmon spawn in the pool-riffle transition zones of the main stem and larger tributaries of a river (De Gaudemar, Bonzom, and Beall (2000); Finstad, Armstrong, and Nislow (2010)). Within these stretches, they seek out the tails of pools, where substrate size allows for females to excavate a space to deposit the eggs to incubate below gravel beds. Fast flowing, well oxygenated water with minimal fine sediments helps to maximize successful embryo development. Atlantic Salmon juveniles (fry and parr) rear in habitat that is deeper and slower, to facilitate their weaker swimming and predation capabilities. Water depth, velocity, and substrate size tend to increase with parr as they increase in size and age. Shelter, in the form of large rocks, boulders, or overhead cover provide crucial refuge for overwintering habitat. Channel gradients most typically associated with these preferred spawning and rearing habitats range from 0.12 to 25%; with highest concentrations below 3% (Amiro (1993)).\nSalmon in the St. Croix watershed are a part of the Inner Bay of Fundy population that was last assessed by Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) as Endangered in 2010 (COSEWIC (2010)) and has been listed on the Schedule 1 of the Species at Risk Act since 2003.\n\n\nAmerican Eel | Kataq | Anguilla rostrata\nAmerican Eel are catadromous species, meaning they spawn in the Sargasso Sea and drift with the ocean currents towards the continental shelf as glass eels. Elvers then continue migrating towards freshwater tributaries to feed and mature, although some populations have been known to stay in the estuaries and bays or move between freshwater and estuary habitat over their life cycle. Their ability to tolerate a wide variety of salinities and temperature thresholds allows them to occupy a variety of habitat types.\nAmerican Eel are widely distributed throughout Nova Scotia rivers, including the St. Croix, and occupy freshwater habitat and estuary habitat for feeding (on small fish, mollusks, insects, and crustaceans) and growth. American Eel were assessed as Threatened by COSEWIC in 2012 (COSEWIC (2012)).",

There are three main branches of the Maqmekwitk, the branch that passes through Panuk, the Herbert River, and the Miluamkitk (Meander River).

Naturally accessible waterbodies were spatially delineated using stream characteristics that define the upper limit of their movement based on species-specific swimming abilities (Table 1).While waterfalls &gt;5m were used as the upper limit for Atlantic Salmon accessibility, our ability to comprehensively model this was limited by incomplete height data for all waterfalls. Future iterations of this project will include field assessment and compilation of local knowledge of waterfall height to further define these boundaries. The spatial extent of the naturally accessible waterbodies layer was then refined based on existing fish observation data and/or redd surveys (for Atlantic Salmon). As a result, all waterbodies were considered accessible in this iteration of the project.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Species-specific stream characteristics used to spatially delineate naturally accessible waterbodies and key habitat for Atlantic Salmon and American Eel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies\nAccessibility Parameters\n\n\n\n\nPlamu, Atlantic Salmon \nChannel gradient &lt;30%; waterfalls &lt;5m \n\n\nKataq, American Eel \nAll stream segments",

There may be more aboiteaux identified currently as stream crossings, but these will require further knowledge exchange, data review and field assessments to confirm. One aboiteau is a confirmed barrier but is low priority due to the low-quality upstream habitat and difficulty in addressing this barrier type.\n\n\nDams\nThere are seven mapped dams that potentially block a combined 154 km of linear salmon and eel habitat in the Maqmekwitk. One smaller dam is located downstream of Fundy Gypsum Mine Yard, one is unknown and requires a field assessment, and five generate hydroelectricity. A set of three hydroelectric dams owned and operated by Minas Energy block the largest proportion of salmon habitat (39%; ~119km of linear habitat) amongst all modelled structure types in the Maqmekwitk watershed.\n\n\nStream Crossings\nStream crossings (i.e., culverts) are the most abundant structure type in the watershed, with 485 stream crossings located downstream of modelled key habitat for Plamu or Kataq. Stream crossings fully or partially block 385 km of salmon and eel habitat. Detailed assessments by CMM were previously completed on 82 stream crossings located downstream of salmon and eel key habitat.

Of the estimated 758 km of key spawning and rearing habitat for Plamu in the Maqmekwitk watershed, 30.54% (231.6 km) is connected to the ocean (Figure 3). Similarly, of the 464.9 km of key eel habitat (used for feeding and growth) in the Maqmekwitk watershed, 32.71% (152 km) is connected to the ocean (Figure 4). These values are likely an underestimate of how connected the system, and additional field assessments and local knowledge exchange to confirm species-specific passability for potential barriers will help to close those knowledge gaps and ensure a more accurate estimate of connectivity status.",

These were spatially delineated for each focal species using natural barriers (i.e., waterfalls, gradient barriers, or subsurface flows) that would limit upstream movement (Table 1).\nHabitat model: A subset of the naturally accessible waterbody layer was defined as key habitat likely to support important life stages, rather than simply movement corridors. The habitat model identifies waterbodies that have a higher potential to support key habitat based on stream characteristics like channel gradient and discharge. The habitat model criteria used were channel gradients &lt;3% for Plamu (Figure 1) and streams with a strahler order of 2 or higher for Kataq (Figure 2).\nConnectivity model: A layer of known or modelled structures was overlaid on the key habitat results. Structures with unknown passability were treated as a full barrier until confirmed passable (100% passable) or partially passable (25, 50, or 75%) by either local knowledge, desktop review, or field assessment. Watershed connectivity was estimated by calculating the amount of key habitat that is connected to the ocean (i.e., not fragmented by human-made barriers). Key habitat with only passable structures downstream was considered fully connected. All key habitat with any full barrier downstream was considered disconnected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Key habitat (channel gradient &lt;3%) and naturally accessible waterbodies (&lt;30% channel gradient and &lt;5m waterfalls) to Plamu (Atlantic Salmon) within the Maqmekwitk (St. Croix) watershed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Key habitat (strahler order 2+) and naturally accessible waterbodies (all stream segments) to Kataq (American Eel) within the Maqmekwitk (St. Croix) watershed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Connected (light blue) and disconnected (red) key habitat for Plamu in the Maqmekwitk watershed.

Depending on the barrier, owner, financial constraints, and quality of upstream habitat, the action may be to leave to end of life cycle before reviewing again, remove and decommission the road, replace with a new passable structure, or modify to temporarily restore connectivity (e.g., fish ladder or baffles installed (Table 1)).\nAssessed structures that remain data deficient list – some form of field assessment has been completed on the structure, but further investigation is required to confirm either the passability status or upstream habitat.\nRehabilitated barriers list – priority barriers that have been addressed (either through removal, replacement, or temporary fish passage improvement projects (Table 2)).\nNon-actionable barriers list – the structure is confirmed to be a barrier to fish passage and have some amount/quality of habitat upstream, but the planning team will not identify actions to address passability of the barrier because of logistic considerations (e.g., financial costs), short habitat gain, or the upstream habitat is of poor quality or unsuitable in its present condition to support key life stages of the focal species (Appendix B).\nExcluded structures list – the structure is excluded from further consideration in subsequent ranking and work planning because the structure is confirmed passable (e.g., bridge), not present, or there is no key habitat upstream (Appendix B).\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: The Maqmekwitk watershed priority barrier list, which includes barriers that have undergone field assessment, been reviewed by the planning team, and selected to be addressed (whether removed, replaced with a passable structure, or provided temporary fish passage).AS = Atlantic Salmon; AE = American Eel; CBS = closed bottom structure.\n\n\nBarrier IDWatercourse NameRoad NameStructure TypePassability Status (AS)Passability Status (AE)Number Barriers GroupTotal Habitat Gain in Set - AS (km)Total Habitat Gain in Set - AE (km)PriorityNext Steps7df79d64-77e8-42a6-af8c-f7ae4cbd5e9fSt. CroixEvangaline TrailDam003119.996.9HighBring barrier to regulator93c5a3a7-bb1c-462f-bf11-8b28f1083ea8St. CroixSalmon Hole Dam RdDam003119.996.9HighBring barrier to regulator4c4d6443-ba54-46dc-bf2c-51922ccb62ccSt. CroixSalmon Hole Dam RdDam003119.996.9HighBring barrier to regulatore4939efd-23a2-4fa7-9622-e5877d9b323cShaw BrookAvondale RoadAboiteaux0024.61.9LowEngage with partnersa90277b6-8708-43ef-a867-86827c4c698fBog BrookRail lineStream crossing - CBS0028.54.5HighEngage with barrier owner02667d40-b792-43e6-94c0-74427481e12aHerbert RiverTrail off Beaverbank RdStream crossing - CBS0012.71.8MediumIdentify barrier owner753ad5c4-da00-40d1-9cc9-fbc6cbdade4cNix BrookUnnamed logging roadStream crossing - CBS0014.32.2HighIdentify barrier ownerae23e5dd-8496-487a-9c95-eae4f63c3cfcBeaver BrookAshdale RoadStream crossing - CBS0012.11.9HighEngage with barrier owner77b3d637-21cb-4728-8548-11d5b02daf22St. CroixS Rawdon RdStream crossing - CBS6.93.8LowLeave until end of lifecycle\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Rehabilitated structures in the Maqmekwitk watershed.AS = Atlantic Salmon; AE = American Eel.\n\n\nBarrier IDWatercourse NameRoad NameAssessment Step CompleteTotal Habitat Gain in Set - AS (km)Total Habitat Gain in Set - AE (km)Next Steps5c859868-f6b5-4291-88ea-d2ed7f0ef41bBog BrookRail lineBarrier assessment0.970.72Post-rehabilitation monitoring",

The ranking process is primarily used to guide field assessments and maximize efficiency in ground truthing data/knowledge inputs and model outputs, while providing a secondary purpose to evaluate the relative key habitat gains of confirmed barriers in the watershed. Field assessments can include an assessment of either the passability status of a structure (whether fish can pass upstream, and to what degree), whether the upstream habitat is suitable for the focal species, and whether there are other undocumented human-made or natural barriers upstream or downstream. First, structures are grouped into ‘sets’. Sets are identified by maximizing the key habitat gain for barriers in the same tributary system. If adding a structure to a set reduces the gain-per-barrier (i.e., the total habitat gain of the set divided by the number of barriers in the set), then it is excluded and will be considered part of another set. This results in sets ranging from one to five structures. Then, each set is ranked by its potential to contribute to restoring the overall habitat connectivity. The higher a set is ranked, the more potential contribution it makes to restoring the overall habitat connectivity, therefore making the set a higher priority for field assessment. By assessing the passability status and upstream habitat of the top-ranked sets, we close knowledge gaps with the greatest influence on the overall connectivity model results.\nSets are ranked by a combination of two factors:\n\nThe long-term potential impact that restoring connectivity at that structure could have on the overall connectivity status. This was measured by calculating and ranking sets by the amount of total upstream key habitat (i.e., ignoring any additional upstream sets). This ranking identifies sets that would have the greatest long-term potential gain in habitat connectivity once any subsequent upstream barriers are addressed.\nThe immediate potential impact that restoring connectivity at that structure could have on the overall connectivity status. This was measured by calculating the amount of functional upstream habitat (i.e., key habitat between that set and the next upstream set of structures). Sets were then ranked by functional upstream habitat amount in tiers, where sets with no downstream sets were ranked first, then sets with one downstream set, and so on. This ranking identifies sets that have the greatest immediate potential gain in habitat by prioritizing sets that do not rely on rehabilitation of downstream or upstream sets to realize these gains.\n\nAn overall ranking for each set was produced as a composite of the long-term and immediate potential gain ranks to prioritize sets that maximize long-term and immediate potential to improve key habitat connectivity in the watershed. All structures in the watershed (excluding those confirmed as passable) were ranked and a subset of those structures were selected by the planning team to assess in the 2023 field season.",
