    "text": "Plan Purpose, Approach, and Scope\nThe following Watershed Connectivity Remediation Plan (WCRP) …\nWCRPs are long-term, actionable plans that blend local stakeholder and rightsholder knowledge with innovative GIS analyses to gain a shared understanding of where remediation efforts will have the greatest benefit for . The planning process is inspired by the Conservation Standards (v.4.0), which is a conservation planning framework that allows planning teams to systematically identify, implement, and monitor strategies to apply the most effective solutions to high priority conservation problems.\nThe planning team compiled existing barrier location and assessment data, habitat data, and previously identified priorities, and combined this with local and Indigenous knowledge to create a strategic watershed-scale plan to improve connectivity. To expand on this work the WCRP planning team applied the WCRP planning framework to define the “thematic” scope of freshwater connectivity and refine the “geographic” scope to identify only those portions of the watershed where barrier prioritization will be conducted, and subsequent remediation efforts will take place. Additionally, the team selected target fish species, assessed their current connectivity status in the watershed, defined concrete goals for gains in connectivity, and developed a priority list of barriers for remediation to achieve those goals. While the current version of this plan is based on the best-available information at the time of publishing, WCRPs are intended to be “living plans” that are updated regularly as new information becomes available, or if local priorities and contexts change. As such, this document should be interpreted as a current snap-shot in time, and future iterations of this WCRP will build upon the material presented in this plan to continuously improve barrier remediation for migratory fish in . For more information on how WCRPs are developed, see Mazany-Wright et al. (2021)."

In turn, these fish provide the continued food, social, and ceremonial (FSC) needs of the Mi’kmaw people, as they have since time immemorial. Both residents and visitors to the watershed will work together, guided by the principles of Etuaptmumk (two-eyed seeing), to mitigate the negative effects of anthropogenic aquatic barriers, improving the resiliency of the watershed for the benefit and appreciation of all.",

    "text": "Project Scope\nConnectivity is a critical component of freshwater ecosystems that encompasses a variety of factors related to ecosystem structure and function, such as the ability of aquatic organisms to disperse and/or migrate, the transportation of energy and matter (e.g., nutrient cycling and sediment flows), and temperature regulation Seliger and Zeiringer (2018). Though each of these factors are important when considering the health of a watershed, for the purpose of this project the term “connectivity” is defined as the degree to which aquatic organisms can disperse and/or migrate freely through freshwater systems. Within this context, connectivity is primarily constrained by physical barriers, including anthropogenic infrastructure such as dams and stream crossings, and natural features such as waterfalls. This plan will focus on the direct rehabilitation and prevention of localized, physical barriers instead of the broad, land-use patterns causing chronic connectivity issues in the watershed. The planning team decided that the primary focus of this watershed connectivity plan is addressing barriers to longitudinal connectivity (i.e., along the upstream-downstream plane) due to the importance of maintaining fish passage to spawning and rearing habitat in the watershed.",

    "text": "Target species\nTarget species represent the ecologically and culturally important species for which habitat connectivity is being conserved and/or restored in the watershed. The selection of these target species was driven primarily by the targets species of the primary fund supporting this planning work.\n\nSAMPLE Anadromous Salmon\nAnadromous salmon are cultural and ecological keystone species that contribute to productive ecosystems by contributing marine-derived nutrients to the watershed and forming an important food source for other species. Salmon species are sacred to the NStQ, having sustained life, trading economies, and culture since time immemorial (W. L. F. Nation. (2021), X. F. Nation. (2021), N. Singi pers. comm.). The stewardship of the resources and fisheries in their traditional territories are imbued in the spirit of the NStQ through a symbiotic relationship based on respect – the NStQ never take more salmon than is needed and there is no waste. The entirety of the salmon is used - smoked and dried to sustain the NStQ through the winter months, the roe harvested for consumption, salmon oil rendered to be stored and traded, and the skin used to store the oil (Wilson, Twohig, and Dahlstrom (1998), X. F. Nation. (2021), N. Singi pers. comm.). The salmon runs begin to return to the Horsefly River watershed in early August, and the NStQ traditionally celebrate and feast at this time. The harvest of the salmon strengthens the cultural connection to the land and the waters, providing an important food source for communities and the opportunity to pass knowledge and ceremony to future generations through fishing and fish processing (W. L. F. Nation. (2021)`, X. F. Nation. (2021)).\nAnadromous salmon populations in the Horsefly River watershed have declined significantly in the past few decades, with the populations of all three focal species being listed as Threatened or Endangered by the Committee On the Status of Endangered Wildlife In Canada (COSEWIC). This has been exacerbated by the Big Bar landslide on the Fraser River in 2019, leading the four NStQ communities to voluntarily close the salmon fishery from 2019-2022. The stewardship of their waters continues through the work of the NStQ member communities and the Northern Shuswap Tribal Council. See Appendix A for maps of modelled anadromous salmon habitat in the Horsefly River Watershed.\n\n\nSAMPLE Chinook Salmon | Kekèsu | Oncorhynchus tshawytscha\n\n\n\nChinook Salmon are the first to return each year, usually in early August DFO (1991), and have the most limited distribution within the watershed. Known spawning occurs in parts of the Horsefly River mainstem above the confluence with the Little Horsefly River and throughout McKinley Creek as far as Elbow Lake (DFO (1991), S. Hocquard, pers. comm.). Important rearing systems include Patenaude Creek, Kroener Creek, Black Creek, Woodjam Creek, Deerhorn Creek, and Wilmot Creek (S. Hocquard, pers. comm.)."

These were spatially delineated for each focal species using natural barriers (i.e., waterfalls, gradient barriers, or subsurface flows) that would limit upstream movement (Table 1).\nHabitat model: A subset of the naturally accessible waterbody layer was defined as key habitat based on the KEA. The habitat model identifies waterbodies that have a higher potential to support key habitat based on stream characteristics like channel gradient and discharge. The habitat model criteria can be found in (Table 1).\nConnectivity model: A layer of known or modelled structures was overlaid on the key habitat results. Structures with unknown passability were treated as a full barrier until confirmed passable (100% passable) or partially passable (25, 50, or 75%) by either local knowledge, desktop review, or field assessment. Watershed connectivity was estimated by calculating the amount of key habitat that is connected to the ocean (i.e., not fragmented by human-made barriers). Key habitat with only passable structures downstream was considered fully connected.

The planning team identified five broad strategies to implement through this WCRP, 1) crossing remediation, 2) lateral barrier remediation, 3) dam remediation, 4) barrier prevention, and 5) communication and education. Individual actions were qualitatively evaluated based on the anticipated effect each action will have on realizing on-the-ground gains in connectivity. Effectiveness ratings are based on a combination of “Feasibility and”Impact”, Feasibility is defined as the degree to which the project team can implement the action within realistic constraints (financial, time, ethical, etc.) and Impact is the degree to which the action is likely to contribute to achieving one or more of the goals established in this plan.",

    "text": "Connectivity Status Assessment Methods\nThe connectivity status assessment … The model spatially locates known and modelled barriers to fish passage, identifies potential spawning and rearing habitat for target species, and estimates the amount of habitat that is currently accessible to target species. The habitat model uses two geomorphic characteristics of the stream network — channel gradient and mean annual discharge — to identify potential spawning habitat and rearing habitat for each target species. The habitat model does not attempt to definitively map each habitat type nor estimate habitat quality, but rather identifies stream segments that have high potential to support spawning or rearing habitat for each species based on the geomorphic characteristics of the segment. For more details on the connectivity and habitat model structure and parameters, please see Mazany-Wright et al. (2021). The variables and thresholds used to model potential spawning and rearing habitat for each target species are summarized in (table).\n\n\n\nTable 1: Additional Key Actors.

The overall aim is to build meaningful partnerships, reduce the threat of aquatic barriers to diadromous fish and the livelihoods that they support. This plan will identify priority actions that CMM, CWF, and other project partners propose to undertake between 2023-2033 to preserve and restore fish connectively in the Maqmekwitk (St. Croix) watershed, with additional watersheds being added in future years (including Shubenacadie and Stewiacke River). This will be done through addressing physical barriers to fish passage. This watershed connectivity plan will be shared with local First Nations, Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), the NS Government, NGOs, and local stakeholders to inform directed efforts to improve fish productivity and diversity in these watersheds.",

    "text": "Focal species\nFocal species represent the ecologically and culturally important species for which habitat connectivity is being directly conserved and/or restored in the watershed. The planning team selected three target species: Plamu (Atlantic Salmon) and Kataq (American Eel). The selection of these key species was driven primarily by local conservation goals.\n\nAtlantic Salmon | Plamu | Salmo salar\nAtlantic Salmon are anadromous fishes, meaning mature adults spawn in freshwater and juveniles rear in freshwater before undergoing a process called smoltification where they migrate out to the ocean for 1-3+ years before returning to the freshwater to repeat this process. Due to this migratory process, salmon require unimpeded access between the ocean and freshwater habitats to complete their life cycle.\nAtlantic Salmon spawn in the pool-riffle transition zones of the main stem and larger tributaries of a river B, Bonzom, and E (2000); Finstad, Armstrong, and Nislow (2010). Within these stretches, they seek out the tails of pools, where substrate size allows for females to excavate a space to deposit the eggs to incubate below gravel beds. Fast flowing, well oxygenated water with minimal fine sediments helps to maximize successful embryo development. Atlantic Salmon juveniles (fry and parr) rear in habitat that is deeper and slower, to facilitate their weaker swimming and predation capabilities. Water depth, velocity, and substrate size tend to increase with parr as they increase in size and age. Shelter, in the form of large rocks, boulders, or overhead cover provide crucial refuge for overwintering habitat. Channel gradients most typically associated with these preferred spawning and rearing habitats range from 0.12 to 25%; with highest concentrations below 3% Amiro (1993).\nSalmon in the St. Croix watershed are a part of the Inner Bay of Fundy population that was last assessed by Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) as Endangered in 2010 COSEWIC (2010) and has been listed on the Schedule 1 of the Species at Risk Act since 2003.\n\n\nAmerican Eel | Kataq | Anguilla rostrata\nAmerican Eel are catadromous species, meaning they spawn in the Sargasso Sea and drift with the ocean currents towards the continental shelf as glass eels. Elvers then continue migrating towards freshwater tributaries to feed and mature, although some populations have been known to stay in the estuaries and bays or move between freshwater and estuary habitat over their life cycle. Their ability to tolerate a wide variety of salinities and temperature thresholds allows them to occupy a variety of habitat types.\nAmerican Eel are widely distributed throughout Nova Scotia rivers, including the St. Croix, and occupy freshwater habitat and estuary habitat for feeding (on small fish, mollusks, insects, and crustaceans) and growth. American Eel were assessed as Threatened by COSEWIC in 2012 COSEWIC (2012).",

    "text": "Connectivity Status Assessment\nThe current connectivity status for each species was estimated using three spatial models:\nAll connected habitats were summed and divided by the total amount of key habitat in the watershed to determine the proportion of connected habitat relative to the entire watershed. Of the estimated 758 km of key spawning and rearing habitat for Plamu in the Maqmekwitk watershed, 30.54% (231.6 km) is connected to the ocean (Figure 1). Similarly, of the 464.9 km of key eel habitat (used for feeding and growth) in the Maqmekwitk watershed, 32.71% (152 km) is connected to the ocean (Figure 2). These values are likely an underestimate of how connected the system, and additional field assessments and local knowledge exchange to confirm species-specific passability for potential barriers will help to close those knowledge gaps and ensure a more accurate estimate of connectivity status.",

After developing the first round of connectivity models, CMM and CWF co-hosted a public community outreach workshop in May 2024 at the Windsor Community Center. The workshop included a short presentation on the project progress and printed maps of the initial model outputs for interactive discussions with local knowledge holders on 1) structures in the Maqmekwitk, 2) salmon and eel movement throughout the rivers, and 3) interests/priorities from community members. One topic that was highly discussed was the 2023 floods, and the need to return to several previously assessed sites to re-assess passability status. After this workshop, CMM and CWF completed field assessments of passability status for 11 highly ranked sites, including two dams and nine stream crossings. The field results were discussed as a planning team and the annual work plan was developed in August 2024 (Table 1).",

    "text": "Geographic Scope\nThe primary geographic scope of this watershed connectivity plan is the Maqmekwitk (St. Croix), which is the larger branch of the Amaqapskiket (Avon River) and drains into the Minas Basin, Bay of Fundy, NS. There are three main branches of the Maqmekwitk, the branch that passes through Panuk, the Herbert River, and the Miluamkitk (Meander River). The Maqmekwitk has a total drainage area of 746.7 km2 (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The primary geographic scope, the Maqmekwitk (St. Croix) watershed.\n\n\n\nThe geographic scope of this project was further refined by identifying naturally accessible waterbodies, which are defined as streams, lakes, or reservoirs that target species would access in the absence of anthropogenic barriers (Figure 2). Naturally accessible waterbodies were spatially delineated using stream characteristics that define the upper limit of their movement based on species-specific swimming abilities (Table 1). While waterfalls &gt;5m were used as the upper limit for Atlantic Salmon accessibility, our ability to comprehensively model this was limited by incomplete height data for all waterfalls. Future iterations of this project will include field assessment and compilation of local knowledge of waterfall height to further define these boundaries. The spatial extent of the naturally accessible waterbodies layer was then refined based on existing fish observation data and/or redd surveys (for Atlantic Salmon). These maps were explored by the planning team to incorporate additional local knowledge, ensure accuracy, and finalize the criteria used to define naturally accessible waterbodies. The new geographic scope formed the foundation for all subsequent analyses and planning steps.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Species-specific stream characteristics used to spatially delineate naturally accessible waterbodies and key habitat for Atlantic Salmon and American Eel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies\nAccessibility Parameters\nKey Habitat Parameters\n\n\n\n\nPlamu, Atlantic Salmon \nChannel gradient &lt;30%; waterfalls &lt;5m \nChannel gradient &lt;3% \n\n\nKataq, American Eel \nAll stream segments \nStrahler order 2+ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Key habitat (channel gradient &lt;3%) and naturally accessible waterbodies (&lt;30% channel gradient and &lt;5m waterfalls) to Plamu (Atlantic Salmon) within the Maqmekwitk (St. Croix) watershed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Key habitat (strahler order 2+) and naturally accessible waterbodies (all stream segments) to Kataq (American Eel) within the Maqmekwitk (St. Croix) watershed.",

    "text": "Structure Types\nThe following section highlights three main anthropogenic structure types (aboiteaux, dams, and stream crossings) that fragment key habitat for Plamu and Kataq in the Maqmekwitk watershed. .\n\nAboiteaux\nThere are three modelled aboiteaux in the Maqmekwitk, each located close to the mouth of the Minas Basin. There may be more aboiteaux identified currently as stream crossings, but these will require further knowledge exchange, data review and field assessments to confirm. One aboiteau is a confirmed barrier but is low priority due to the low-quality upstream habitat and difficulty in addressing this barrier type.\n\n\nDams\nThere are seven mapped dams that potentially block a combined 154 km of linear salmon and eel habitat in the Maqmekwitk. One smaller dam is located downstream of Fundy Gypsum Mine Yard, one is unknown and requires a field assessment, and five generate hydroelectricity. A set of three hydroelectric dams owned and operated by Minas Energy block the largest proportion of salmon habitat (39%; ~119km of linear habitat) amongst all modelled structure types in the Maqmekwitk watershed.\n\n\nStream Crossings\nStream crossings (i.e., culverts) are the most abundant barrier type in the watershed, with 485 stream crossings located downstream of modelled key habitat for Plamu or Kataq. Stream crossings fully or partially block 385 km of salmon and eel habitat. Detailed assessments by CMM were previously completed on 82 stream crossings located downstream of salmon and eel key habitat. Of these 82 structures, nine were in the top 30 ranked sets ({numref}WCRPtableX).\n\n\n\n\nAmiro, P. 1993. Habitat Measurement and Population Estimation of Juvenile Atlantic Salmon (Salmo Salar).

    "text": "Field Assessment Ranking Process\nAfter all existing data and knowledge are collated for known and modelled crossings, an iterative ranking process was conducted. The ranking process is primarily used to guide field assessments and maximize efficiency in ground truthing data/knowledge inputs and model outputs, while providing a secondary purpose to evaluate the relative key habitat gains of confirmed barriers in the watershed. Field assessments can include an assessment of either the passability status of a structure (whether fish can pass upstream, and to what degree), whether the upstream habitat is suitable for the focal species, and whether there are other undocumented anthropogenic or natural barriers upstream or downstream. First, structures are grouped into ‘sets’. Sets are identified by maximizing the key habitat gain for barriers in the same tributary system. If adding a structure to a set reduces the gain-per-barrier (i.e., the total habitat gain of the set divided by the number of barriers in the set), then it is excluded and will be considered part of another set. This results in sets ranging from one to five structures (see Appendix A for more details on this process). Then, each set is ranked by its potential to contribute to restoring the overall habitat connectivity. The higher a set is ranked, the more potential contribution it makes to restoring the overall habitat connectivity, therefore making the set a higher priority for field assessment. By assessing the passability status and upstream habitat of the top-ranked sets, we close knowledge gaps with the greatest influence on the overall connectivity model results.\nSets are ranked by a combination of two factors:\n\nThe long-term potential impact that restoring connectivity at that structure could have on the overall connectivity status. This was measured by calculating and ranking sets by the amount of total upstream key habitat (i.e., ignoring any additional upstream sets). This ranking identifies sets that would have the greatest long-term potential gain in habitat connectivity once any subsequent upstream barriers are addressed.\nThe immediate potential impact that restoring connectivity at that structure could have on the overall connectivity status. This was measured by calculating the amount of functional upstream habitat (i.e., key habitat between that set and the next upstream set of structures). Sets were then ranked by functional upstream habitat amount in tiers, where sets with no downstream sets were ranked first, then sets with one downstream set, and so on. This ranking identifies sets that have the greatest immediate potential gain in habitat by prioritizing sets that do not rely on rehabilitation of downstream or upstream sets to realize these gains.\n\nAn overall ranking for each set was produced as a composite of the long-term and immediate potential gain ranks to prioritize sets that maximize long-term and immediate potential to improve key habitat connectivity in the watershed. All structures in the watershed (excluding those confirmed as passable) were ranked and a subset of those structures were selected by the planning team to assess in the 2023 field season.",

Depending on the barrier, owner, financial constraints, and quality of upstream habitat, the action may be to leave to end of life cycle before reviewing again, remove and decommission the road, replace with a new passable structure, or modify to temporarily restore connectivity (e.g., fish ladder or baffles installed ({numref}Table2).\nAssessed structures that remain data deficient list – some form of field assessment has been completed on the structure, but further investigation is required to confirm either the passability status or upstream habitat ({numref}Table3).\nRehabilitated barriers list – priority barriers that have been addressed (either through removal, replacement, or temporary fish passage improvement projects ({numref}Table 4).\nNon-actionable barriers list – the structure is confirmed to be a barrier to fish passage and have some amount/quality of habitat upstream, but the planning team will not identify actions to address passability of the barrier because of logistic considerations (e.g., financial costs), short habitat gain, or the upstream habitat is of poor quality or unsuitable in its present condition to support key life stages of the focal species (Appendix B).\nExcluded structures list – the structure is excluded from further consideration in subsequent ranking and work planning because the structure is confirmed passable (e.g., bridge), not present, or there is no key habitat upstream (Appendix B).\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: The Maqmekwitk watershed priority barrier list, which includes barriers that have undergone field assessment, been reviewed by the planning team, and selected to be addressed (whether removed, replaced with a passable structure, or provided temporary fish passage).\n\n\nBarrier IDInternal NameWatercourse NameRoad NameStructure TypePassability Status (AS)Passability Status (AE)OwnerNumber Barriers GroupTotal Habitat Gain Group (AS)Weighted Total Habitat Gained Group (AS)Total Habitat Gain Group (AE)Weighted Total Habitat Gained Group (AE)Upstream Habitat QualityPriorityNext StepsReasonNotes7df79d64-77e8-42a6-af8c-f7ae4cbd5e9fLower St. Croix - hydroelectric facilitySt. CroixEvangaline TrailDam003119.93680191.73469796.85677290.738809HighBring barrier to regulatorneed to submit a FOIPOP and ATIP93c5a3a7-bb1c-462f-bf11-8b28f1083ea8St. Croix hydroelectric facilitySt. CroixSalmon Hole Dam RdDam003119.93680191.73469796.85677290.738809HighBring barrier to regulatorneed to submit a FOIPOP and ATIP4c4d6443-ba54-46dc-bf2c-51922ccb62ccUpper St. Croix/Salmon Hole Dam - hydroelectric facilitySt. CroixSalmon Hole Dam RdDam003119.93680191.73469796.85677290.738809HighBring barrier to regulatorneed to submit a FOIPOP and ATIPe4939efd-23a2-4fa7-9622-e5877d9b323cShaw BrookAvondale RoadAboiteaux0024.5896702.9803131.8919971.418998LowEngage with partnersCMM says it will be difficult to address this barrier.
